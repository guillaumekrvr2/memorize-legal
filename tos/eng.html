   <h2>1. OUR SERVICES</h2>
<p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>Memorize is primarily designed for competitive memory athletes and individuals training for memory competitions (World Memory Championships, national championships, and similar events). The training methods, difficulty levels, and performance metrics are calibrated for competitive memory sports.</p>
<p>While anyone interested in memory training may use the app, users seeking general cognitive improvement, brain health applications, or therapeutic benefits should note that the app's competitive focus may not align with those goals. We recommend evaluating whether the app's competitive training approach suits your personal objectives.</p>
