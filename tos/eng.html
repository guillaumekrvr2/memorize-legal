   <h2>1. OUR SERVICES</h2>
<p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>Memorize is primarily designed for competitive memory athletes and individuals training for memory competitions (World Memory Championships, national championships, and similar events). The training methods, difficulty levels, and performance metrics are calibrated for competitive memory sports.</p>
<p>While anyone interested in memory training may use the app, users seeking general cognitive improvement, brain health applications, or therapeutic benefits should note that the app's competitive focus may not align with those goals. We recommend evaluating whether the app's competitive training approach suits your personal objectives.</p>

   <h2>18. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
<p>These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of France, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>

<h3>European Union Users</h3>
<p>If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in your country of residence. Guillaume Kervran and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Tours, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to these Legal Terms in France, or in the EU country in which you reside.</p>

<h3>Users Outside the European Union</h3>
<p>For users residing outside the European Union, these Legal Terms shall be governed by French law to the extent permitted by applicable law in your jurisdiction. If your local laws require different dispute resolution procedures or consumer protections, those requirements shall apply in addition to these terms.</p>

   <h2>19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

<h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
<p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a 'Dispute' and collectively, the 'Disputes') brought by either you or us (individually, a 'Party' and collectively, the 'Parties'), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>

<h3>Binding Arbitration (EU Users Only)</h3>
<p>For users residing in the European Union, any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these Legal Terms shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Paris, France. The language of the proceedings shall be French. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of France.</p>

<h3>Users Outside the European Union</h3>
<p>For users residing outside the European Union, disputes may be resolved according to the dispute resolution mechanisms available in your jurisdiction, or by mutual agreement between the parties.</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law:</p>
<ul>
    <li>no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</li>
    <li>there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilise class action procedures; and</li>
    <li>there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</li>

    <li>any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and</li>
    <li>any claim for injunctive relief.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

   <h2>28. NON-MEDICAL DISCLAIMER</h2>

<h3>Medical Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Memorize is designed for competitive memory training and entertainment purposes only. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical or cognitive condition. The app does not provide medical advice, and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical consultation, diagnosis, or treatment. Users with pre-existing cognitive or neurological conditions should consult a healthcare professional before using this app. We make no claims about the medical or therapeutic benefits of memory training exercises. By using Memorize, you acknowledge that cognitive performance results may vary and are not guaranteed. We are not liable for any cognitive, psychological, or physical effects resulting from app usage.</p>

<h3>Photosensitivity and Seizure Warning</h3>
<p>A very small percentage of people may experience seizures, epileptic episodes, or blackouts when exposed to certain visual stimuli, including flashing lights, patterns, or images that may appear in this app. This may occur even if the person has no history of seizures or epilepsy. If you or anyone in your family has an epileptic condition or has experienced seizures of any kind, consult a physician before using this app.</p>
<p><strong>DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY</strong> and consult a physician if you experience any of the following symptoms while using the app:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
    <li>Altered vision or visual disturbances</li>
    <li>Eye or muscle twitching</li>
    <li>Loss of awareness or disorientation</li>
    <li>Involuntary movements</li>
    <li>Convulsions</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents should monitor their children's use of the app for these symptoms. Use of the app by children should be supervised by adults, particularly for extended periods.</p>

<h3>Scientific Claims Disclaimer</h3>
<p>While Memorize provides memory training exercises based on techniques used by competitive memory athletes, we make NO CLAIMS that using this app will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improve your general intelligence or IQ</li>
    <li>Prevent or delay cognitive decline or dementia</li>
    <li>Treat any neurological or psychological condition</li>
    <li>Transfer memory skills to real-world tasks outside of competitive memory sports</li>
</ul>
<p>The exercises in Memorize are designed specifically for competitive memory training and performance improvement within structured memory competitions. Any cognitive benefits beyond competitive memory performance are not scientifically validated by us and may vary significantly between individuals. This app is for entertainment and competitive training purposes only.</p>

<h3>Responsible Usage Warning</h3>
<p>Intensive memory training can cause mental fatigue, stress, and frustration. We recommend:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Taking regular breaks during training sessions</li>
    <li>Not exceeding 2-3 hours of continuous training</li>
    <li>Discontinuing use if you experience headaches, eye strain, or mental exhaustion</li>
    <li>Not using the app as a substitute for sleep, rest, or proper health care</li>
</ul>
<p>Competitive memory training is mentally demanding. Listen to your body and mind, and prioritize your overall well-being over performance metrics.</p>

<h3>Performance Tracking and Mental Health</h3>
<p>Memorize includes leaderboards, performance statistics, and competitive rankings. These features may create pressure, comparison anxiety, or negative self-perception if performance does not meet expectations. If you find that tracking your performance or comparing yourself to others negatively affects your mental health or well-being, we encourage you to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Disable leaderboard features in settings</li>
    <li>Focus on personal progress rather than rankings</li>
    <li>Take breaks from the app</li>
    <li>Consult a mental health professional if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: competitive memory performance does not define your worth or intelligence.</p>
    
    <h3>Photosensitivity and Seizure Warning</h3>
    <p>A small percentage of people may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual stimuli. <strong>DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY</strong> and consult a physician if you experience:</p>
    <ul class="alert" style="list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Altered vision</li>
        <li>Muscle twitching</li>
        <li>Loss of awareness</li>
        <li>Convulsions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scientific Claims Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>We do not claim that this app will improve IQ or prevent dementia. Training benefits are specific to competitive memory sports.</p>

    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
    <p>If competitive rankings cause anxiety, we encourage you to disable leaderboards or take a break. Performance metrics do not define your worth.</p>
